install dependencies
`npm install`

run application
`npm start`

extra feature:
since the api included a `genre` property for each book, I decided to build out a genre filter. the `genre` is random gibberish so it didn't turn out as well as I hoped but I wanted to give you guys an idea of how it would work with a real world API.
